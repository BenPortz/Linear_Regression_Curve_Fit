# Linear_Regression_Curve
Uses Image processing to create a linear regressive curve fit of data taken from a image file. The app also extracts the function of the fitted curve.

Motivation:
While working in an R&D lab an engineer was using old data acquisition software from an electronic transducer signal. The setup had not been used in years and the technician who set the data test bench up had retired. The engineer brought it to me and asked if I could use excel or MatLAB to find the function that fit the messy data. I used that software, but decided it would be fun to make a little app that could solve all kinds of function types. I also wanted brush up on my python knowledge and make a cool little app. This is the result of that conversation.
